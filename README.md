![Screenshot from Le Hangar Pully](src/assets/images/ReadMe-screenshot.webp)

This is version 2 of the repository for an actual website made for a friend who owns a hair salon: [https://www.lehangarpully.ch/](https://www.lehangarpully.ch/)

The website had to be dark and industrial, responsive, and simple.

It contains links for booking and everything one would need to access the salon easily.
